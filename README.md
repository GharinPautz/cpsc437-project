### Project Title: 
A Python program for Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. The program is for adjacency matrix representation of the graph. We, as a group, have chosen  this routing alrorithm to implement and demonstrate.

### Motivation
We all had a small understanding of Prim's Algorithm before this class so we decided it would be a good idea to research more into how it works.
